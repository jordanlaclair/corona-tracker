# Covid-19 Statistics Tracker 👨‍🔬 🧫

## General Info

An application that keeps track of various COVID-19 facts (some listed below). Majority of code was made during my summer of quarantine during COVID-19 when I just started learning React. Polished it a little since then. 😃 I learned a lot in this project including working with API's and working with React virtual DOM.
